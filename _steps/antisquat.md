Some people I knew started getting a flurry of phishing credit card links in their emails and text messages. This was the inspiration for [AntiSquat](https://github.com/redhuntlabs/AntiSquat), an AI-powered phishing domain finder and typosquatting detector that can help organizations catch similar-looking domain names.
