Got my Bachelor's degree from [KLS Gogte Institute of Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gogte_Institute_of_Technology).
Made some amazing friends. What a fun four years.

College taught me the concept of makeshift/workarounds/jerryrigging/hacks, or as Hindi speakers call it - "जुगाड़". Finding quicker solutions to problems irrespective of the status quo helps you generate alternate and unique perspectives on how things work.
For example, folding your clothes and keeping them under your bed while sleeping overnight to "iron" them, reusing an old laptop as a gaming console or home server, hanging up wet curtains to use them as passive air-conditioning, using your backpack as dumb-bells,
gluing things together, you name it!
