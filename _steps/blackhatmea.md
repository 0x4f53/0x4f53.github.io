!سلام عليكم، سعوديه
.شكراً للذكريات
(و مبروك للهلال)

Presented [Octopii v2](https://blackhatmea.com/session/octopii-ai-powered-personal-identifiable-information-pii-scanner) and [BucketLoot](https://github.com/redhuntlabs/bucketloot) with Umair in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Met tons of people, learned a myriad of new stuff from them.

I was also interviewed [about my journey in cybersecurity](https://insights.blackhatmea.com/look-the-other-way/) and some of [my experiences there!](https://insights.blackhatmea.com/what-you-loved-about-black-hat-mea-2023/), which they were kind enough to publish.
