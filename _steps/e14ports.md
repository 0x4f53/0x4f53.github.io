My second ever reverse-engineering/port. This one was a bit more difficult than I expected, so I left it alone. A lot of people starred it and were willing to fund it though. Yet another fail lol.

If you'd like to contribute, contact me or fork the project.

Lenovo basically cheaped out on their hardware and tried to use Shenzhen Goodix fingerprint scanners because they're
cheap. However, this OEM hasn't made anything open source or available online, making Linux compatibility of these
scanners an absolute nightmare.
