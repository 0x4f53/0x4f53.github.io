Wrote my first library, [GetPerms](https://github.com/4f77616973/GetPerms). Nothing special, was just curious to see
how many permissions can an Android app read from other Android apps. To my surprise - a lot! To a point where
you can almost "fingerprint" people's phones.

Fortunately, Google [fixed this in Android 11](https://developer.android.com/training/package-visibility).
