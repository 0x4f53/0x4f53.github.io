My initial Polytechnic school final year project I made with Nelson. Got rejected because it wasn't "CS enough" (whatever that means).

The idea was to link large distances with lasers so that I could have calls with my friends in the neighborhood without worrying about
cell phone bills. A prototype of this worked, though it sounded extremely attenuated. I thus got the idea of submitting it as a
project, but they rejected it and imposed upon us the idea [of some strage app](https://gitlab.com/ThomasCat/gogreencampus).
