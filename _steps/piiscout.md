Started working on [Piiscout](https://github.com/0x4f53/Awesome-PII-discovery-dorklist) with [Othman Ali Khan](https://github.com/othmanalikhan), who helped with regional PII definitions for Saudi Arabia, and [Abhijeet Ingle](https://github.com/nyxragon), who helped with the regional PII dorks for Maharashtra, India.

The tool is educational in nature. It is an attempt to continuously catch PII leaks that most people don't notice using super-duper AI x OCR magic.
