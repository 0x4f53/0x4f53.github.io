Turns out math is not as difficult as it seems. Everyone has a style of learning, and mine was through visualization, as
opposed to rote memorization of techniques and formulae. I sat down and went back to the basics of arithmetic, what numbers
are, and the concepts of statistics and calculus, deriving everything from scratch. I also tried seeing how these all plot on
a graph, and how incorporating this into day-to-day life can make it easier.

This philosophy of making skillsets interoperable and transferable helped me immensely (for example: realizing that 
summation functions are for loops, that Wi-Fi and cellular signals used Fourier Transforms, Material Design animation 
used interpolators in Calculus etc.), and is something I learned to apply in other parts of my life.

It fits perfectly in line with the concept of the [locus of control](https://www.usmcu.edu/Portals/218/What%20is%20Locus%20of%20Control%20by%20James%20Neill.pdf)
