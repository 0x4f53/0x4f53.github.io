Turns out math is not as difficult as it seems. Everyone has a style of learning, and mine was through visualization, as
opposed to rote memorization of techniques and formulae. I sat down and went back to the basics of arithmetic, what numbers
are, and the concepts of statistics and calculus, deriving everything from scratch. I also tried seeing how of these would plot on
a graph, and how incorporating this into my daily life made it easier.

This philosophy of skillsets being interoperable and transferable helped me immensely (for example: realizing that summations in statistics are for loops, that Wi-Fi and cellular signals used Fourier Transforms, Material Design animation used interpolation in calculus etc.), and made the universe around me feel beautiful and alive. For the first time, everything made sense.

This nearly 8 year long struggle with math reminds me of [Claudia Mueller and Carol Dweck's locus of control experiment.](https://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/14/science/praise-children-for-effort-not-intelligence-study-says.html)
