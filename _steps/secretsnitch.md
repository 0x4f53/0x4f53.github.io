[Secretsnitch](https://github.com/0x4f53/secretsnitch) is a tool I wrote to help bug bounty hunters grab hundreds of secrets from multivariate sources in a matter of seconds.

This tool can catch millions of secrets across GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Dockerhub etc. It helped me catch tons of AWS Secrets, mongodb production credentials and several others for fintech companies, government departments etc.

Update: This tool was taken down due to a cease-and-desist notice from my former employer.
