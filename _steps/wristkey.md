Wrote a completely standalone two-factor authentication app for Android Wear / Wear OS. Google pulled their Authenticator out of the Wear Play Store and I needed an offline 2FA authenticator because my G Watch W100 doesn't have WiFi. [Released it on GitHub](https://github.com/4f77616973/Wristkey) to help others in my situation.

Turns out the app is a bit unique, in that it can read data from USB and can perform direct Wi-Fi transfers from devices meaning any Android-based device can run the app.
