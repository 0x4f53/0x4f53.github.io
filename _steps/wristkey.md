Wrote a completely standalone two-factor authentication app for Android Wear / Wear OS. Google pulled their Authenticator out of the Wear Play Store and I needed an offline 2FA authenticator because my G Watch W100 doesn't have WiFi. [Released it on GitHub](https://github.com/4f77616973/Wristkey) to help others in my situation. 

The app is now unexpectedly unique, in that it can read data from USB, perform encrypted Wi-Fi transfers and can import 
from several password managers, irrespective of platform or manufacturers, meaning that any 
Android-based device can run the app, without any pairing required.

Gained unexpected popularity and got mentioned on Reddit a bit.
